# Hello, I'm Ruslan Hovdik ðŸ‘‹

I am a seasoned Senior React Developer with a strong foundation in crafting robust and scalable applications. My expertise spans a wide range of technologies, including:

- React.js and Next.js for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- TypeScript and JavaScript for writing clean and maintainable code.
- Material UI, Chakra UI, and React Bootstrap for designing sleek and intuitive UI components.
- Node.js for server-side JavaScript development.
- RESTful APIs to ensure seamless communication between different parts of the application.
- AWS for deploying and managing scalable and secure cloud-based solutions.

With a keen eye for detail and a passion for delivering high-quality software, I thrive on turning complex ideas into elegant solutions. Let's build something great together!
